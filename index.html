        <h3>Group Project: Number Conversion, Skill Searcher, and Translator</h3>
        <p>This project was done in a group of 4. The goal of this project was to create three different programs to complete their own tasks. Task one was to convert decimal numbers into hexadecimal, binary, and octal form. The second task was to create a skill searcher to search for different people via skill search. The final task was a translator that takes in English and displays the word or phrase in a translated language. </p>
